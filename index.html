                <p>
                    Hi! <br><br>
                    My name is Michelle Andersson. I was born in southern Sweden where I lived the first eight years of my life. My family then moved to 
                    Ethiopia where my parents worked as missionaries for EFS for six years. We lived in a small countryside village called Nakamte for 
                    three years and then moved to the capital city Addis Abeba for three years. In Nakamte I studied at a small Swedish school
                    consisting of myself and my two brothers while in Addis I studied at the international school.  After Ethiopia we moved to Colorado, 
                    USA and lived there for four years. <br><br>

                    Growing up in Africa is an experience that really made me grow as a person. I got to see the world from another perspective than 
                    most Swedish children do at that age. Sometimes it was hard to so often see suffering and hardship all around me, but it gave me 
                    a very realistic view of what the world can look like. <br><br>

                    I graduated from high school in the US in 2012. My education included a year of Outdoor leadership training which included 
                    leadership skills and wilderness survival among other skills. During the summers I worked as a leader at an outdoor nature camp 
                    in the rocky mountains which included working in the kitchen, teaching ceramics, and being a counselor for children and teenagers. 
                    During high school I also studied university courses in multimedia and competed with great success in public speaking. I both enjoy 
                    and have extensive experience in speaking in front of large groups of people. <br><br>

                    After graduation my family moved back to Sweden. I then spent a year at Sundsgården Folkhögskola in order to get Swedish grades. 
                    After that I spent a year at Glimåkra Folkhögskola studying bible studies which included a 6 month volunteer trip to Tanzania to 
                    work as an English teacher at a preschool, work with Compassion International, and general work with the local church in the 
                    village of Kongwa. In 2014 I started my bachelors studies in International Human Rights at Malmö University.  During my time at 
                    university I also studied International Migration and Ethnic Relations, Refugee and Asylum Law, and Social Medial and Digital 
                    Communications. I graduated with my bachelors degree in 2017. During my studies I also worked part time at The North Face and 
                    Aquatica Dive Center in Malmö. After graduation I started working as a sales consultant at Storm Group and later moved to work at 
                    PwC in Lund where I started working as an auditing assistant but later moved to first work as a general specialist and finally as 
                    statistic and quality specialist. While working at PwC I also studied Marine Biology. In 2019 I started working at Ikano Bank as 
                    credit manager and customer service representative while also studying Environmental Issues and Sustainable Development. Currently 
                    I am studying Front End Development at Pink Programming in Malmö. <br><br>

                    As a person I am reliable and dedicated to the tasks I’ve taken on. If I have been given a task, I make sure to get it done to the 
                    best of my abilities and not let difficulties stand in my way. I work well in groups as well as am able to plan and complete 
                    projects on my own. I am organized and efficient and feel that people in my surroundings enjoy spending time with me. I am also 
                    flexible and have an easy time learning new things.<br><br>
                    <br>
                    I hope for further contact with you! <br>
                    Best regards, <br>
                    Michelle Andersson
